## Notes for redistributors

If you fork dubyduby and ship a packaged build (rather than the source repo + setup.sh pattern), the following rules become your responsibility:

- **Pretendard (SIL OFL 1.1)** — Include the OFL text alongside the font file. Reserved Font Name handling applies if you rename the font.
- **ffmpeg-full** — Contains GPL components (e.g. `libx264`, some `--enable-gpl` filters). Bundling it makes your derivative work GPL. Many filter-only flows can use plain `ffmpeg` (LGPL).
- **yt-dlp (Unlicense)** — No constraints. Note that *using* yt-dlp to download copyrighted YouTube content has its own legal considerations independent of yt-dlp's license; this tool is intended for content you have rights to translate/dub.
- **Supertonic** — Check current license on its [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/supertonic/) before redistributing model weights or binaries.

## Fixture / sample content

`samples/demo-karpathy-5min.mp4` includes a 5-minute excerpt from Andrej Karpathy's public talk on Claude Code, dubbed by dubyduby for demonstration purposes. Original content © Andrej Karpathy. This sample is included under fair-use / academic-demonstration grounds — if the original creator objects, open an issue and it will be removed.

Voice samples in `samples/{M1..M5,F1..F5}.mp3` are short clips synthesized by Supertonic from short neutral phrases, included as voice previews for the user.
